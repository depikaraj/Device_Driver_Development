There are three drivers in this demonstration

sachin.c - basic module
deepa.c  - module with a load time parameter
bhalu.c  - driver with a load time parameter and runtime changeable attributes.

The command to build a module is:

   make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=mymoduledir modules

This command will process the Makefiles in the kernel build directory and then
look for a file called Kbuild in your module directory to specify the list of
modules to be built. A detailed description of Kbuild is at
Documentation/kbuild/. In particular, read the modules.txt file on how to build
modules out of the kernel source tree.

In our directory, we use a top level Makefile0 file for convenience. It uses
the above make command to build all the three modules and clean up after the
build.

Makefile0 - top level makefile to build each module by invoking kernel build

Kbuild 	 - simple kernel build spec for the three modules

sachin.c is a basic module which just loads, does nothing and exits cleanly. It
shows the basic structure of a kernel module.

deepa.c introduces load time parameter called flag with a default value. This
value can be changed while loading the module.

bhalu.c is a module that combines a simple driver and a device with two
attributes. The name attribute is readonly and shows the name the kernel has
allocated to the device (e.g. bhalu1). The color attribute is read-write and
can be modified at any time.

Building Sachin		$ make sachin.ko

Checking module info 	$ modinfo ./sachin.ko

Loading module		$ sudo insmod ./sachin.ko

Listing module		$ lsmod  | grep sachin
	or		$ grep sachin /proc/modules
	or		$ ls -l /sys/module/sachin

Viewing syslog		$ tail -f /var/sys/log
	or		$ dmesg | tail -f

Unloading module	$ sudo rmmod sachin
	or		$ sudo modprobe -r sachin

Loading module with param	$ sudo insmod ./deepa.ko flag=23

Reading a device attribute	$ cat /sys/devices/bhalu1/name
Modifying a device attribute	# echo red >/sys/devices/bhalu1/color
	or			$ echo red | sudo tee /sys/devices/bhalu1/color
